Pseudocode:

User can click on one of three notes on the page: Movies, TV Shows, Books
Once click on one, card gets an overlay of "See my list" or "Get random" (possibly also option to input new item)

SEE MY LIST:
If select See my list, card expands to overlay of the chosen category
Here there is an input field for user to enter new item in that category.
On the right hand side is a list of items already in category (maybe populated with one default item that user can remove? like "Nothing yet!")
Next to item is a checkbox labeled "remove" which user can check to remove item
Whatever user enters into submit field is appended to the list on the right hand side
If item is removed, it's removed off list

Items are added to a general Firebase database 
User can click on a done button to close card and be back on screen with selected card

GET RANDOM:
Random item from the user's list on firebase is displayed on the card
User has the option to get an alternate item
Also option to go "back" to first screen with get random, my list, (and input)
If there are no items, user gets a note that says "sorry no items yet! Go to your list to add some!"

*May need to change MVP if I can't do the code for get random

**Maybe useful: Think of it as a problem to solve. Each step is a problem to solve. Break into simple steps. when you have trouble, try looking it up. If all fails, get some help.

*Start basic skeleton and then as you build can move stuff around.
*Review notes on Fun-Food-Friends both versions. Should greatly help.
